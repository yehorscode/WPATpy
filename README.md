# WPATpy
A translator for all your non needed needs

Python

What does this do?
This app translates english sentences letter by letter with a nato dictionary they use for communicating via phone etc. Its quite interesting

Supports custom alphabets
I planned to do more alphabets, but as i seen there arent really more similar alphabets i could findd tbh.
App uses .ini configs (my new favourite config format!)
